# App Name Ideas for Your Study App

Since "Muse" is taken, here are some creative, modern, and available name ideas for your AI-powered study application.

## 1. "Muse" Variations (Keeping the Soul)
If you love the name Muse, try adding a relevant word to it.
*   **MuseScholar** (`musescholar.com`)
*   **MuseCampus** (`musecampus.com`)
*   **MuseMate** (`musemate.com`)
*   **MuseBrain** (`musebrain.com`)
*   **MuseDeck** (Great if you focus on Flashcards)

## 2. Brain & Intelligence (AI Focused)
Highlight the AI/Smart features of your app.
*   **Synapso** (Play on "Synapse")
*   **CortexNote**
*   **MindFlow**
*   **CogniNote**
*   **BrainScribe**
*   **LuminaStudy** (Shedding light on knowledge)

## 3. Action & Focus (Productivity)
Names that sound fast and efficient.
*   **StudyFlux**
*   **NoteWise**
*   **FocusVault**
*   **JotSmart**
*   **Lectura** (Latin for "Reading/Lecture")

## 4. Short & Modern (Tech Startup Vibe)
*   **Kno** (Knowledge) -> `getkno.com`
*   **Zent** (Zen + Student)
*   **Vellum** (Old paper, but modern app)
*   **Aura** -> `auranotes.com`

## My Top 3 Recommendations:

1.  **Synapso** (Sounds smart, modern, and unique).
2.  **MuseScholar** (Keeps your original name but makes it specific to studying).
3.  **Lumina** (Sounds premium and enlightening).

### 💡 Pro Tip:
Go to **Namecheap.com** and type these in. If the `.com` is taken, try **`.io`** (very popular for tech) or **`.app`** (perfect for applications).
*   Example: `synapso.io`, `lumina.app`, `muse.study`
